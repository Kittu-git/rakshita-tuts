1 Create a Virtual Machine (VM):
* In the Google Cloud Console, go to the Compute Engine section.
* Create a new VM instance with the desired specifications.


2 Configure Firewall Rules:
* Ensure that your VM has the necessary firewall rules to allow traffic on ports 8080 (Jenkins) and 22 (SSH).


3 Connect to the VM:
* Use SSH to connect to your VM.


4 Install Jenkins:

* Update the package list: " sudo apt-get update "
* Install Java: " sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk "
* Add Jenkins repository and key:
wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io.key | sudo apt-key add -
sudo sh -c 'echo deb http://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'

* Install Jenkins: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install jenkins


5 Start Jenkins Service:
* Start the Jenkins service: sudo systemctl start jenkins
* Enable Jenkins to start on boot: sudo systemctl enable jenkins


6 Access Jenkins:
* Open a web browser and navigate to http://YOUR_VM_IP:8080.
* Retrieve the Jenkins unlock key from the server by running sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword and follow the on-screen instructions.


Remember to secure your Jenkins installation by configuring authentication, setting up SSL, and following best practices for securing a Jenkins server. Adjust these instructions based on your specific needs and the Linux distribution you're using on your VM.
